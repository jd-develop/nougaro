![Nougaro. A programming Language.](repo-image.png)

This is Nougaro beta 0.17.0.

Nougaro is a programming language interpreted in Python.

## Third-party modules (optional)

 Python builtins that are not always builtin (why?):

* `colorama` (`pip install colorama`)

 Under Linux:

* `readline` (`pip install readline`)

## Run

 Execute the shell with `python3 shell.py`. Open files with `python3 shell.py filename.extension`.
 Generally, we use `.noug` as extension for Nougaro files.

 The code is compiled for Windows and Linux. Check it out in the [releases](https://github.com/jd-develop/nougaro/releases/) tab!

 Supports Python 3.11 and 3.12.

## Documentation

 Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/jd-develop/nougaro/wiki/) for documentation.

## About syntax highlighting

 The notepad++ file was no longer updated, so I deleted it from the repo.

 I’m planning to create a VSCode extension – if you know something about that, contact me!

## How it works?

 Everything is explained [here](how_it_works.md) :)
