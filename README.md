![Nougaro. A programming Language.](repo-image/repo-image.png)

This is Nougaro version `1.0.0`.

Nougaro is a programming language interpreted in Python.

## Third-party modules (optional)

 Python builtins that are not always builtin:

* `colorama` (`pip install colorama`)

 Under GNU/Linux, to allow browsing command history with the arrow keys:

* `readline` (`pip install readline`)

## Run

 Execute the shell with `python3 shell.py`. Open files with `python3 shell.py filename.extension`.
 Generally, we use `.noug` as extension for Nougaro files.

 The code is compiled for Windows and GNU/Linux. Check it out in the [releases](https://github.com/jd-develop/nougaro/releases/) tab!

 Supports Python 3.11 and 3.12.

## Documentation

 The documentation is available [here](https://nougaro.github.io/documentation).

## About syntax highlighting

 The notepad++ file was no longer updated, so I deleted it from the repo. Here is [its last version](https://github.com/jd-develop/nougaro/blob/973303409d2f7a91d1b45e44f57ebdb517abde53/highlight%20theme%20for%20NPP.xml).

 I’m planning to create a [VSCode extension](https://github.com/jd-develop/nougaro-highlight-theme) – if you know something about that, contact me!

## How it works?

 Everything is explained [here](how_it_works.md) :)

## Language goals

 The main goal of this language is, for me, to learn how interpreted languages work. It is not intended
 to be blazing fast, memory safe and bleeding edge, but to be easily understandable.

> [!Important]
> I do *not* recommend to use Nougaro in real projects.
